ANDY
He was born on the same day as Marlon Brando.
He hasn't even seen Wally.
We laid everything out, Hawk, and we can't find anything that's missing.
This is here.
And 
Are you okay, punky? 
That's missing. That's missing. Do chocolate bunnies have anything to do with your heritage? 
Do you want another bunny, punky? I can get you more bunnies.
Lucy. Lucy. You were on the phone with her again, weren't you? 
I hate cellular phones. 
Oh, punky. Punky.
Cell phones that means they're mobile, punky. The sheriff can be moving. It's not like your phone. He can be moving and even driving while he's talking. Lucy you're so good at your job in every other way. I just don't understand how this keeps happening over and over again.
You collect yourself. I've got to go see Sheriff Truman.
I'm here, Sheriff Truman.
She gets messages from her log.
It's Wally. We're so excited. He came in unannounced.
Hawk? Have you found any Indians? Anywhere? I-I haven't found any Indians.
But that's your truck.
But if you weren't driving, I need to know who was.
The logging road above Sparkwood and 21.
Just past Jones', down by the creek.
See you there.
4:30, then.
And, Lucy, I really love the red chair.
I'm sorry, pumpkin. You can get the beige chair.
I did.
And what all did your father do up there, Bobby? 
And we have to put some soil in our pockets.
We need to get her down the mountain. She's very important, and there are people that want her dead. She's fine physically. We need to put her in a cell where she'll be safe.
Don't tell anybody about this.
They're beautiful, Lucy.
Yes, I do.
You're a very bad person, Chad. Give good policemen a bad name.
Agent Cooper, is that you? Agent Cooper, it is you. We were just talking about you.
Everyone's gonna be so happy to see you.
Come on in. I was just taking this picnic basket in. We'll make a fresh pot of coffee.
Lucy. Lucy, look who's here.
Sheriff Truman, this is Special Agent Dale Cooper. We haven't seen him since before Wally was born.
Have a seat, Agent Cooper.
Would you like a cup of coffee? 
Okay. I'm going to go tell Hawk you're here.
Very important. Very important.
Hawk, are you down here? 
I've got to get you all upstairs.
In here.
