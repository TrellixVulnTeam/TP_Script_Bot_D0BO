JANEY-E
Dougie? Is that you? Dougie! Where have you been? What is this? 
Three days without a word? You don't show up at work, and you miss Sonny Jim's birthday. How could you? 
Get inside.
What have you been doing? Huh? Why didn't you call me? Where'd you get that black suit and that haircut, Dougie? What's in this bag? Huh? Dougie? Dougie. Dougie, there's there's thousands and thousands of dollars here. Where did you get this? Did you get this at the Silver Mustang? Huh? Dougie! Don't tell me you hit the jackpot.
You won it? Dougie? Well, there's there's enough here to pay them back. The You could We could Oh oh This is the most wonderful horrible day of my life.
Yes. I'm gonna fix you a sandwich, and then I'm gonna get you a piece of Sonny Jim's chocolate cake, 'cause we saved a piece for you. Okay? Oh, Dougie. I'm so glad you're home, Dougie.
Dougie! You're not even dressed! Is something wrong? What's go Oh, for God's sake. What is with you? Listen, Mr. Dream Weaver, you go potty, and then let's get you dressed fast. You're worse than Sonny Jim.
Dougie, you've lost weight! Let me cinch this up. And this jacket looks two sizes too big. That black suit last night fit you perfectly. We'll just have to take that to the cleaners and maybe get you another one. Okay. You do your tie. I can never get that right. Now, I have to go downstairs and finish up breakfast. Hurry up. Sonny Jim! Get going! 
Sonny Jim, get down here! 
Here's your coffee.
Dougie! 
Go get in the car, Sonny Jim. Okay, I hid the money. I counted it $425,000. Don't worry. It's in our secret place. Now, when you get to work, call them and set up a time and pay them their 50 grand, okay? Then we'll be free and clear. 
Okay, Dougie, you're acting weird as shit. Just don't forget to call them, okay? And no more drinking and gambling. Now get going. You'll be late for work.
Damn. Your car. Okay, get in. I'll drive you. Where is your car, anyway? In the car! 
Get out of the car, Dougie. I think you're having one of your episodes. Now listen to me. You need to pull yourself together and get to work. Get out of this car now. Get out of this car and go to work. Dougie, get to work. Dougie! Honestly.
Just a second. Dougie? 
Uh, yes, of course I do. He's my husband, Dougie Jones. Where have you been? 
That's on a good day.
Oh thank you, very much, officers, for bringing him home. Come on, sweetheart. Let's get you in.
Yeah, he 
He likes Thank you. Thank you, officer. Come on in.
Oh. Thank you again. Good night.
Dougie, I'm sorry, I forgot, your car. Where is your car? Have you eaten? Come on. I'm gonna fix you a sandwich. Tomorrow lunchtime, I'm taking you to see Dr. Ben. He needs to take a good look at you.
And what are these? 
And this one there's nothing written on it. Okay, Dougie, you need to go upstairs and say good night to Sonny Jim. He's been waiting up for you.
Go upstairs and say good night to Sonny Jim. Upstairs! 
Dougie.
Dougie! Get down here right now! Right now! 
Not tonight, he isn't. Mommy will be up soon, honey. Get down here, right now! You are in the doghouse, mister. You were supposed to call them and set up a time to pay them off, and look, this shows up! Do you have an explanation for this? 
Jade? So that's her name, is it? 
I'll bet she did. And you admit you know her. Look at you two, holding each other like that. 
 Are you gonna answer that? 
Maybe it's Jade calling! 
Oh, my God, Dougie. We are not done with this. Hello? 
Who is this? 
He's indisposed.
Yes, I did, thank you very much. Now, you listen to me. How much does he owe you? 
No, he didn't tell me. I'm just finding out about all this right now.
A and how's he supposed to get that? Hmm? Who can get that kind of money? And what if he doesn't have it? What are you gonna do then? Break his legs? Think about it, it's hard enough to get that kind of money, let alone with broken legs.
No, no, no, no. Don't you dare go to his office. I'll talk to you myself. In the park, at the corner of Guinevere and Merlin by the mall. I'll be the one carrying the red purse.
Noon-thirty tomorrow. 
What a mess you've made of our lives, Dougie. Now, what am I gonna do with you? I was gonna take you to see Dr. Ben tomorrow during your lunch hour. And now I have to meet your friends at 12:30. I w-where's your car? And your wallet? What happened to your wallet and your identification? And if that's work, you better get started right away. The last thing we need is you losing your job, Dougie. Okay, now, I'm gonna go upstairs and say good night to Sonny Jim. Tomorrow's a big day.
Oh, Dougie 
Yes, sweetheart. 
Yes. Now let's get to it. Explain to me exactly what Dougie did to make him owe you money.
What do you mean, "he borrowed it"? 
So let me get this straight. People were playing games. He made a bet where he lost $20,000. But you want him to pay you back $52,000? 
Okay, so you get this straight. My husband has a job, he has a wife, he has a child, he does not make enough money to pay back $52,000 for anything. We are not wealthy people. We drive cheap, terrible cars. We are the 99 percenters. And we are shit on enough. And we are certainly not gonna be shit on by the likes of you.
So here's what we're gonna do. Without my knowledge, my husband came to you for a loan of $20,000. You were nice enough to give it to him. But he should never have been gambling like that. I'm gonna pay you back. Now, at my bank, where we make less than one percent interest on what little money we have, people would be turning cartwheels just to get 25 percent interest on any loan, and that is what I'm generously gonna give to you right now, $25,000. That is my first, last, and only offer to you. What kind of world are we living in where people can behave like this? Treat other people this way without any compassion or feeling for their suffering? We are living in a dark, dark age, and you are part of the problem. Now, I suggest you take a good, long look at yourselves because I never want to see either of you again.
What's going on here? 
I'm his wife. What's going on here? 
That's why I'm here.
I'm picking him up. He doesn't know where his car is.
Dougie, was your car stolen? 

No, he did not report it stolen. I would know. His car went missing. We haven't seen it. Isn't that your department? 
Well, I guess this is as good a time as any. He doesn't know where the car is. He hasn't seen it in a few days, so, yes, there's a very strong possibility that it was stolen.
Well, if we knew that, we'd know where to find it, wouldn't we? 
Ah, it's a terrible car, always in the shop Silver, four-door, cheap Ford, the kind they call down at that dealer a "previously owned" car.
Dougie? Dougie. A few days ago.
Reason? Yeah, I'll tell you a reason. There's more to life than cars. Too many cars, too much going on, and Dougie's been under a lot of stress lately, and if you want to know the truth, so have I.
He owns this place.
Why didn't you tell us that to begin with? 
Well, there's your answer. Now, if you don't mind, our son's home alone waiting for his supper, and in case you think we're neglecting him, he's being watched by our neighbor as a favor, and we'd like to go. We were supposed to be home by now at the end of a very long and stressful day, which I'll tell you about later, Dougie. Come on, let's go.
Thanks, Mr. Mullins.
So I met with them. I told them what the arrangements were gonna be, and I gave them more than they deserved, and that's the end of them, okay? Now, with this car business, yes, there's gonna be some insurance money. I don't know how much, but, Dougie, just think. If you hadn't blown that money gambling $25,000 plus the insurance We could have gotten you a great new car. Now who knows what we'll get? But I do not want you running off and gambling any more of that jackpot. That money is for Sonny Jim and our future. Just 'cause you have it now doesn't mean you can just run off and risk one more penny.
Do you hear me? 
No more gam 
Get off him! 
Dougie! 
Are you okay? Oh, Dougie. What Are you okay? 
And he just he just Dougie took right over, and he just chopped him right in the throat and said, "You get off," and I kicked him, and I punched him, and that was it, and and Dougie just took care of business. Right, baby? 

Well, that's great, because I can take him to the doctor.
Oh, no, thanks, but thanks for bringing one for Dougie.
Anyway, as I told you, Dr. Ben, it started last week when Dougie disappeared for three days. He missed Sonny Jim's birthday party, which we'd been planning for six months, and then he shows up straight from the casino. You know about his gambling problems and then the drinking, and the drinking feeds the gambling and vice versa, and the whole thing is just a downward spiral.
Well, he's just I don't know acting peculiar.
How much weight has he lost? I-I-I think he's lost a lot of weight. In a good way.
Remarkable.
Then we came down, and I was holding on to Dougie. We were having a regular conversation about his money and insurance and-and No, Dougie, don't do that. And we were just walking along, minding our own business, and I held on to him, and then, out of nowhere, someone came right at us, pointing a gun at my husband, and we were just Dougie! He wa he started The gun went off, and it scared me, and my Dougie, he gave him a good old karate chop in the throat, and I punched him a couple times. I said, "Don't you touch Just get off him! Get off him!" And then we he ran off! I don't know where he went, and it was it was just 
You just took care of business, right, Doug 
Dougie. Do you find me attractive? 
Well? Do you? I find you attractive. Dougie. Dougie! Oh, yes. Oh. Yes, Dougie. Yes. Dougie. Dougie! Dougie! Dougie. Dougie. Dougie! Dougie! Dougie! Dougie! 
Dougiiieee! Dougie. Oh, Dougie. 
Dougie? I love you.
Dougie.
Sonny Jim, go get in the car. I can't stop thinking about last night. You're so wonderful.
Mm. I just had to tell you that. Okay. Let's get you to work.
Hold on just a minute.
Yeah? 
W-what? 
And the car, too? 
Backyard? 
Oh, Dougie. When you didn't come home last night, I thought the worst. Look what you've done. Sonny Jim's in seventh heaven.
Mm. And then the car Oh, Dougie I love you so much.

Oh, Dougie.
Here you go, Dougie.  Is it delicious? 
Oh, Dougie. It's like all our dreams are coming true. 


Yeah, but when people go into a coma, they can stay there for years.
No, honey.
Oh, oh. Um, Sonny Jim, these are the men who, uh who bought your gym set and and the car. Thank you.
Thank you.
Oh.
Yeah, well, the doctors are very hopeful.
Oh. Wow. Okay, um Here you go. Thank you.

Okay. Let's go find you the little boys' room.
Dougie? 
Dougie.
Oh, my Dougie.
Yeah.
Okay.
Dougie, are you sure this is a good idea? 
Okay. Come on, Sonny Jim. Daddy thinks we should get the car around.
Yeah, he sure is, Sonny Jim. 
But, Dougie 
What's going on, Dougie? 
You're not gonna start gambling again, are you? 
Where are we going? 
What? 
What what are you saying? 
You're not Dougie? 
Don't go.
Whoever you are, thank you.
Just a second. Dougie!
