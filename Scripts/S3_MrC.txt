MR. C
Otis.
Hello, Buella.
Buella, Ray and Darya Have you got them back there somewhere? 
And, Buella, put something better at your front door.
See ya, Otis.
You did good. You follow human nature perfectly. This is George's gun.
I'm not worried, Ray, about anything.
For a while, day after tomorrow, I'll need to be on my own. That might be a good time for you to learn how to mind your own business.
I'll be sure to let you know, Ray.
Want, not need. I don't need anything, Ray. If there's one thing you should know about me, Ray, it's that I don't need anything. I want. And I want that information. Kind of funny that she'll only give it to you.
And I better be able to trust that information.
Jack, come here.
Who you talking to? 
Mm.What did Jack say? 
You're happy to see me, Darya? 
That's nice, Darya. Ray was supposed to meet me this afternoon. He never showed.
Yeah. 
Where's that 45 of yours, Darya? 
Might want to borrow it for a job.
Darya, Jack is dead. I killed Jack two hours ago after he wired the car.
Don't move 
one muscle. I'm gonna play something for you, Darya.
I think we'll both find this interesting. 
Shh.
Yes, Darya.
Darya who hired you and Ray to kill me? 
Hmm? 
Do you really expect me to believe that Ray's in prison for carrying guns over a state line? Darya, look at me. This is quite an interesting thing to think about. The game begins. Did he say why they want me dead? 
How much do they want me dead? What are they paying you? 
Shut up, Darya.
Tomorrow, I'm supposed to get pulled back into what they call the Black Lodge. But I'm not going back there. I've got a plan for that one. But this prison thing with that fucker Ray 
Darya, did Ray get that information from Hastings' secretary? 
Did he ever mention coordinates to you? 
Geographical coordinates, numbers, letters. They could save your life.
Anybody ever show this to you before? Do you know what this is? Huh? Did you ever see anything like this? This is what I want.
Yes, Darya.
Phillip? 
Couldn't be helped.
And you're still nowhere, is that correct? 
How did you know that? Phillip? 
This is Phillip Jeffries, right? 
Who is this? 
It's me. I need you to clean up in room six. Everything.
Then go get your husband. I need you and Hutch in a certain area in a few days. I'll get word to you.
Chantal, come here. Oh. You're nice and wet.
It's yrev very good to see you again, old friend.
I haven't seen you in a long, long time.
Gordon, I've really, really missed spending time together.
Gordon, I've been working undercover all these years, working primarily with our colleague Phillip Jeffries.
I need to be debriefed by you about this work, Gordon. I will tell you the whole story, all its twists and turns, and I was going to do so. I was on my way to present it to you. I was a little bit behind schedule when my car veered over across the road, and I had my accident.
I need to be debriefed by you, Gordon. I was on my way to present it. I was a little bit behind schedule when my car veered over off the road, and I had my accident. 
I've left messages.
Messages so Phillip knows it's safe. Gordon? When are you going to get me out of here? 
Of course, I will be exonerated in courts of law.
I've never really left home, Gordon.
And now food is coming. 
You're still with me.That's good.
Thank you, Warden Murphy.
Now that everyone's here, I will make my phone call. Now, who should I call? Should I call Mr. Strawberry? 
No, I don't think I'll call Mr. Strawberry. I don't think he's taking calls. I know. I know who to call.
The cow jumped over the moon.
I knew it was going to be you. It's good to see you again, Diane.
Are you upset with me, Diane? 
I think you're upset with me.
At your house.
I'll always remember that night.
I don't know what you mean, Diane.
Listen to me a minute. Tell Warden Murphy I have a message for him. I need to speak with him in his office.
Just tell him we need to speak about a strawberry.
The dog leg. That dog had four legs. One you found in my trunk. The other three went out with the information you're thinking about right now. Two people you don't want coming around here if anything bad happens to me.
Joe McCluskey.
I want a car. Cheap rental, if you like. For myself and Ray Monroe. I want a friend in the glove compartment One a.m. tonight. Smooth and safe. And if your mind should wander to a place where I might not make it out of here alive, remember the dog legs. I'm not interested in you. You'll never see me again, and no one will ever hear anything more about Joe McCluskey or your late Mr. Strawberry.
You drive.
There are three tracking devices on this car. Get up close behind that truck.
That should do it.
Darya told me what happened. You needed to get out, Ray.
She's waiting for a phone call when we get someplace safe.
You'd probably like to go to that place they call "The Farm‚Äù 
You have something I want, Ray.
You think so, do you? 
There it is. Take that little road up there on the right. Let's get off this highway, Ray.
Go for it.
Ray. I want that information. 
Looks like you're out half a million.
Who owns this establishment? 
Where are they? 
A couple clean phones. And something for this.
Did you do it? 
Better be done next time I call. 
It's real good, Hutch.
I want you to kill a warden within the next two days.
Whatever you want. Then I got a doubleheader for you in Vegas.
I'll text you details after you do the warden. Remember this. Warden Murphy, Yankton Federal Prison. Kill him at home, at work, or on the way.
I'll take a rain check.
Kill that phone. And clear out of this place.
Hey, Ray, you in here somewhere? 
Came to see you, buddy.
I came to see my friend Ray.
What is this, kindergarten? Nursery school? What do I get if I win? 
I don't want to be your boss. But if I win, I want him.
Ready.
Starting positions.
Starting position's more comfortable.
It hurt my arm when you moved it down here.
But it really hurt when you had it down here.
See? 
Doesn't that hurt your arm when I go like that? 
I think it's much worse when it's down here.
Let's go back to starting positions. It's really much more comfortable.
Give me some cell phones.
Ray and I are gonna need some privacy.
Now we can talk.
No. Somebody hired you to kill me. Who is it? 
I can make you tell me.
Keep talking.
Why? 
Did he ever mention Major Briggs? 
Easy, Ray.
Where did you get that? 
Who gave it to you? 
Put it on. Ring finger, left hand.
Now you know what I want, Ray.
Depends on what's in the pocket.
Ray, where is Phillip Jeffries? 
Ray, where's Phillip Jeffries? 
I know what it is.
I'm looking for Phillip Jeffries.
Jeffries.
Why did you send Ray to kill me? 
So you did send him? 
Did you call me five days ago? 
So it was someone else who called me? 
Yes, we did.
1989.
You showed up at FBI headquarters in Philadelphia and said you'd met Judy.
Phillip.
Why didn't you want to talk about Judy? Who is Judy? Does Judy want something from me? 
Who is Judy? 
What do you mean, I've met Judy? 
Who is Judy? 
Who is Judy? 
How do you figure that? 
Where'd you see that picture? 
Who's your mom? 
Don't ever threaten me again.
Get in the truck. We'll talk on the way.
Pay attention. You'll find out. I'm looking for a place. Do you understand the place? 
Three people have given me coordinates to that place. Two of the coordinates match. What would you do, Richard? 
You're a very bright young man. And we're very close to the two that match. It says it's right up there.
Yeah. We're going up there right now.
I'll bet it's right up there on that rock. I'm 25 years your senior. Take this and get on up there. It'll beep when you're close and make a continuous tone when you're on it. Let me know what you find.
Oh. Good-bye, my son.
What is this? 
Hello, Andy.
And I would like to see them, too.
Hello, Lucy.
So I understand.
Sheriff Truman? 
Sheriff.
No, thanks. I'm all right.
In the flesh.
Unfinished business.
